### Hello There ðŸ‘‹
I'm Niklas, a Computer Science student from Germany. I have developed games in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and contribute to projects I find useful.
Before starting with Godot, I used to make games in [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/).

You can find my personal games at https://nalquas.itch.io.

I also occasionally develop games in a team called Penguin Psychiatry.
You can find our games at https://penguin-psychiatry.itch.io/.
